# Memory-Game

A memory game that allows you to test yourself on getting the lowest score possible. This game is complete with a Star Rating, depending on how many moves it takes you to win, move counter and a timer. At the end of the game a modal will pop up with your results and will allow you to either play again, which will reset the stats, or close the modal.
